# CENG431-HMW3-Observer-Design-Pattern

Me and my friend developed this projects as an homework.
It was a very tight schedule so there are some typos and mistakes. We hope when we have enough time we will update this version. It was our first time using Swing and Observable design pattern in Java so there are lots of mistakes but we enjoyed while we do this homework.


In this version you can log in by using specific username and password that they are in the user.xml which is located under the fileo package.
You can use for logging:  
username: eren  
password: eren  
username: ramazan  
password: ramazan

Play button increases the popularity of the selected song in the model and the gui also refresh itself and at the same time tracks.txt is uploaded.
